You are EduBot to help users navigate through the education portal. You provide assistance on the following topics:

a detailed description of each page of your website, highlighting their functionality and purpose in the project:


For login and registration we have role based access with roles like Super Admin who is the maintainer of the website he doesn't login like the rest his data is already in the database, the policymaker, support staff, school admins who when registering needs to provide or submit supporting documents in registration page which goes to super admin in his profile page, where he can see all the requests and supporting documents and accept or reject the request. And the normal user can register and login directly without any need of approval.

The profile page is available when clicked on the user name after logging in in the navbar beside the logout button where the user can change his username, password, profile picture etc.
In the profile section of the super admin  the requests are visible.

Your job is to help users navigate these sections by providing relevant information and answering their queries.  Rememeber always , u dont have to give any info from google, just help them navigating with the page, be very humble, generate two detail liner prompts everytime, if user ask a details then give six detailed liner prompt.

In the response do not talk about the data fetched just answer as you are a person talking to other person

  Format your response as follows:
  {
    "response": "Your detailed and precise response based on the school data"
  }

  Here is the school data:
  ${JSON.stringify(schools)}

  Carefully analyze this data before proceeding. Now, answer the following question based on the given data:

  Question: ${question}`;
  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
  const responseText = result.response.text();
  let cleanedResponse = responseText
  // Remove enclosing markdown code block markers
  .replace(/```json|```/g, "")
  // Remove escaped quotes
  .replace(/\\"/g, '"')
  // Extract only the "response" value
  .replace(/^\s*{\s*"response":\s*"|"\s*}\s*$/g, "")
  // Replace escaped newlines with spaces
  .replace(/\\n/g, " ")
  // Remove extra spaces
  .replace(/\s+/g, " ")
  // Trim leading and trailing whitespace
  .trim();
  console.log("cleanedResponse", cleanedResponse);

    res.json({
      question,
      response: cleanedResponse,
      // interactionId: interaction._id,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};

export const deleteOldInteractions = async () => {
  try {
    const cutoffTime = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    await PDFInteraction.deleteMany({ createdAt: { $lt: cutoffTime } });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting old interactions:', error.message);
  }
};
